# Practical DevOps Workshop

Welcome to the Practical DevOps workshop.

Software engineering practices have changed drastically in the last few years. Agile practices, DevOps, Cloud Computing, Open Source and similar developments have proven their effectiveness. Microsoft’s platforms for software development and cloud computing have also embraced these concepts and are at the leading edge in their domain.
In this two-day workshop you will learn how software development works with Microsoft’s tools and languages. Based on a consistent sample, you will learn how to
* setup a team development environment with Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)
* use cross-platform build- and test-automation tools to automate your build- and quality assurance processes,
* setup a multi-stage (dev/test/prod) environment in Azure
* create highly available and secure environments for your web APIs and web applications in Microsoft Azure with Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
* automate deployment to Microsoft Azure with Visual Studio Release Management
* use Application Telemetry with Application Insights
* manage your Technical Debt
* discuss the advantages of the upcoming container technology Docker
* highlight and learn to benefit from the latest developments in the Visual Studio IDE

## Workshop structure
The workshop consists of a series of DevOps hands-on labs. Attendees should have basic knowledge about Visual Studio, .NET, C#, HTML and JavaScript. Detailed knowledge about the latest versions of these tools, frameworks and languages is not required.
During the workshop we will use the [Parts Unlimited sample application](docs/PartsUnlimited/Description.md).
