# Lab #4 - Parts Unlimited - The Sample Application

Parts Unlimited is an example eCommerce website site based for training purposes on the website described in chapters 31-35 of The Phoenix Project, by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford, © 2013 IT Revolution Press LLC, Portland, OR. Resemblance to “Project Unicorn” in the novel is intentional; resemblance to any real company is purely coincidental.

The website includes product listings by category, product details, shopping cart, order history, product recommendations, search, and more.

## Key Features of the Parts Unlimited sample application

- Modern HTML5 responsive layout using bootstrap for mobile, tablet, and PC
- Application is build with ASP.NET Core
- Designed for Azure Websites, support for Staging slots, Testing in Production, and environment variables for feature flags (to turn off recommendations)

- Works with Visual Studio 2015 Update #3
- Supports multiple authentication options including Azure Active Directory, Google, and Facebook
- Entity Framework code-first using SQL Azure or an in-memory database (Mono)
