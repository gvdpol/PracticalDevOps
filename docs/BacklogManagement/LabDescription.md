# Lab - Backlog Management and Agile Planning

In this lab we will setup the Azure DevOps Team Project to manage the backlog items and plan the items for the sprint executed during the workshop.

## Tasks Overview

### Task #1. Configure the Team Project for Agile Planning

In this task, you will first configure or prepare the Azure DevOps Team Project to manage the backlog items.
In the project setting of our Team Project we will first configure the sprint schedule (iterations) and areas used in the project.
We will use only one team in this project, but Azure DevOps allows you to add multiple teams to your project, so that can scale your agile project.

- Go to the **Project Settings** (click **Project settings** in the lower left corner of the screen).
- Next select **Project configuration** in the **Boards** section.
- On the iterations tab specify the dates for the first two sprints, for this workshop the sprints have a length of one day.

- Select the **Team configuration** in the **Boards** section.
- On the **General** tab select the backlog levels you want to display on the team's page. Also look at the other settings on this page, we will later see that we can also configure them in the Azure Boards hub.

- Next select the **Iterations** tabs, and make sure the first two iterations are selected for the team.

#### Task #2. Adding the items to our Product Backlog

We have configured the basic settings to start managing our Backlog.
Navigate to the Azure Boards hub and select the Backlogs page.

We will add a number of backlog items to our backlog, and take some time to explore the features of the backlog and board.

During this exercise you will explore how to

- add items
- change the priority of the items in your list
- change the layout of the list (columns)
- how to map items to a feature
- configure the look and feel and behavior of both the backlog and the (kanban) board
- and more...

#### Task #3. Planning our first sprint

In this task we will select a number of the items from the Backlog for our first sprint.
We will do a short planning exercise to highlight the agile planning features of Azure DevOps.
This time, besides looking at the sprint backlog and (task) board, we will look at the managing the capacity of our sprint.

We will close this lab with a short overview of related features, like work item queries, delivery plans and a first look at the dashboard functionality.
During the various labs please go back to the your dashboard and update it so that it presents the status of the items we have delivered.
In this first step we will look at presenting the progress of the sprint on the dashboard and present insights at the stories delivered.
