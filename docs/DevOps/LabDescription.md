Lab - DevOps introduction
====================================================================

In this lab we will introduce some of the DevOps Practices presented in this workshop.
This will not be a hands-on lab, discuss with the other attendees what practices you are familiar with, what practices you are already applying and what practices are still on your backlog.

Navigate to [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) and explore the contents.

Take some time to explore practice like:

- Agile Planning tools
- CI/CD
- Repos
- Test Plans
- Artifacts

Articles discussing the [DevOps at Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/) will also present valuable insights.
We will present some slides during this lab to discuss the DevOps practices explored during this workshop.
